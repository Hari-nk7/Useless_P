# MUTTA ROAST üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CELESTIA


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adhul Krishna - SSET
- Member 2: Sneha Sunil - SSET
- Member 3: Hari Narayan - SSET

### Project Description
The game is basically something that provides anxiety for the people who want relaxation at their leisure time. In every aspect of the game there is an element of surprise and a fun yet dissapointing twist. 
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The hectic lifestyle of an average human and the level of stress can never be compensated with. That can be turned into an endless pit of anxiety. A game of control where you have absolutely no control and where you come have a relaxed time after a long day, so that you eventually fall into the pit of anxiety and get disturbed at the peak level.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution to the problem is not what we are providing but infact its the opposite that we're doing. We are providing stress and anxiety to a person who is already exhausted with or stressed with whatever they go through in their daily motion.

This is the Menu Page consisting three games, where the player end up on either not completing the game or even if the player completes it via any loopholes, it still remains useless as there is no reward.

<img width="1262" alt="platformer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdd450ac-6c16-4e9e-8e9b-e0dcd86467c3">
The player has to jump over the platforms, that floats above lava, to collect the egg, at the end. But, the second last platform is decoy, and will make the player fall into lava, which will give a hint that the platforms are useless and the lava is safe. But still, at the end , the player will fall into lava-pit just before collecting the egg, which makess the whole game pointless.



<img width="1263" alt="Egg_catcher" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addfeb03-bb9c-40af-a43e-f49fc2148885">
The player has to catch the egg and burn it in the lava-pit. But the egg moves farther as the player gets closer (which makes it impossible to catch the egg). The player may use tricky complex movements to push the egg into the lava, but at the end the lava is a decoy which makes the game impossible to complete.



<img width="1262" alt="Maze" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770d715d-e498-4e8c-a2d8-590d5c89e29e">
The player will have to find a way to the centre to fetch the egg. But, after all the effort, the player will realise the maze is a decoy and the egg is unfetchable. All the time used for finding a way to the egg is completely useless.
